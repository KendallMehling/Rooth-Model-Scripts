# Rooth-Model-Scripts

The Following Scripts have been used to test the Rooth model under various parameter regions. This work has been done under the guidance of Malte Jansen and is designed to aide in the understanding of box models as they pertain to ocean circulation. Most of the work comes from, or is an extension of the work of Longworth et. al (2004) or Rahmstorf (1996) and is compiled together to further conceptual understanding.
